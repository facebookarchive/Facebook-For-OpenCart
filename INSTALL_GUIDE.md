# Pre-requisites prior to installing the plugin
  1. The plugin supports these OpenCart versions - 2.0.x.x to 2.2.x.x, 2.3.x.x, 3.x.x.x and above.

  2. Remove all existing pixel implementations from the website. Duplicate pixel events may be fired if there are existing pixel implementations.

  3. If you were previously using the Facebook Business Extension plugin version 3.1.2 and below, please follow the Uninstall Guides below to uninstall the existing plugin before attempting to install the new plugin:
      - For Facebook Business Extension version 2.x.x to 3x.x, please click [here](#uninstall-the-plugin)

  4. Ensure that your web server uses PHP version 7.2 and above. This is because the plugin uses Facebook Business SDK internally and it requires PHP version 7.2 and above.
  
  5. Download the latest version of the plugin file, ```Facebook_Business_Extension-OCxxx.ocmod.zip```, where xxx is the OpenCart version you are using.
      - You can get the latest version of the plugin from these websites:
        - [OpenCart marketplace](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=32336)
        - [Github latest release](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Facebook-For-OpenCart/releases/latest)

      - Ensure that the plugin file ends with ```.ocmod.zip``` extension. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fHks0Ab0Wlo42xGqaK09QjHi8QKK-aIi/view?usp=sharing)

      - Ensure that you've downloaded the correct zip file for your OpenCart installation.
  
  6. Installation of the plugin is via the OpenCart Extension Installer for all OpenCart versions. For OpenCart 2.0.x to 2.2.x, the plugin uses OCMOD (OpenCart Modifications) as well.
      - For OpenCart 2.0.x to 2.2.x:
        - You need to either
          - Option 1: Enable FTP option. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-QS-vZtpZgun5lJXnn5H0UGriAm_YujF/view?usp=sharing)
            - Go to the admin panel of OpenCart and click on Settings.
            - Click on Edit button of your store.
            - Click on FTP tab and setup your FTP details.
          - Option 2: Install QuickFix: Extensions Installer issue when FTP support disabled. 
            - [Download Link](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=18892)
        - Installation of the plugin through manual upload of the plugin's files onto your web server is not recommended as the OCMOD script will not be installed correctly. You should only install the plugin through manual upload if you are able to install the OCMOD script correctly. Otherwise, the extension will not work correctly.
        - vQmod installation is NOT supported.
          
      - For OpenCart 2.3.x or OpenCart 3.x:
        - There is no additional setup required as the extension uses OpenCart Events instead of OCMOD.
        - Installation of the plugin through manual upload of the plugin's files onto your web server is supported.

  7. Our plugin uses the default OpenCart folder structure, i.e. admin, catalog and system.
      - If your folder structure is not the same **AND** you are performing the installation of the plugin through manual upload, you will need to change the directory names of the plugin accordingly or ensure that you are uploading into the correct directories.
      - If you are performing installation through the OpenCart Extension Installer, you do not need to take any actions.

  8. Our plugin will generate the catalog feed of all your products and upload it to Facebook after the setup for Facebook Pixel and Catalog has been completed. Depending on your web server and database server configurations, you may experience issues if you have a large product catalog, e.g. more than 5000 products. You may also need to increase the memory settings for your web server and database server. Please kindly refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Facebook-For-OpenCart/blob/master/FAQ.md) for more details.

  9. Since our plugin uses the Facebook Business SDK internally, the plugin file size might exceed your pre-defined PHP ```upload_max_filesize``` value. You may need to increase the value of ```upload_max_filesize``` for your web server in order to install the plugin.
