# Building Facebook Business Extension for OpenCart from the source codes
Look for the correct version for your OpenCart installation and zip up contents of the folder. Rename the zip file to `Facebook_Business_Extension.ocmod.zip`. Please ensure that the zip file ends with `.ocmod.zip`, otherwise, installation will be unsuccessful.

- The only folder that should be in the root of the zip file is the "upload" folder. Do NOT include any other sub-folders in the root of the zip file as it will result in unsuccessful installation of the plugin.

- For **OpenCart 2.0.x to 2.2.x**, please ensure that the `install.xml` file is also located in the root of the zip file. This means that the root of your zip file contains **two** items: one `upload` folder and one `install.xml` file.

- For **OpenCart 2.3.x to 3.x.x** and above, the root of your zip file should only contain **one** item: one `upload` folder.
