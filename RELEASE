* Fixed an warning issue - A non-numeric value in catalog/controller/extensino/facebookeventparameters.php on line 494

2.2.0 - 11 Nov 2019
* Changed the product catalog sync method. On earlier versions, the plugin adopted 2 approaches - using feed file for initial catalog sync and API for subsequent product changes. From this version onwards, the plugin is adopting feed file for both initial catalog sync as well as subsequent product changes.
  1. There will be a daily feed pull to update the product catalog changes from your OpenCart website to Facebook product catalog.
  2. For existing plugin merchants, you need to perform a step to automatically generate the daily pull mechanism. Access the Facebook Business Extension module, click on Manage Settings, click on Advanced options. You will be able to see the notification indicating that the Catalog sync is successful. See screenshot here - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dAF88Spg-iAwPXmkwcVvAqg82UYJ5IJ0
  3. Access token is no longer needed and there is no longer any need to update the access token nor to keep the Facebook account signed in.
  4. Better integration with other 3rd party product plugins. You can use any of the 3rd party product plugins to perform add/edit/delete product changes. These product changes will be automatically updated to Facebook via the daily feed mechanism.
  5. You can trigger immediate product sync to Facebook. Access the Facebook Business Extension module, click on Manage Settings, click on Your Products. Click on Fetch Now to sync your products to Facebook. See screenshot here - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bCTT4gU4gC8pi6T6HLhpe2fkHWI-RvhN

  1. OpenCart quantity of (1 or more) = Facebook in stock
  2. OpenCart quantity of (0 or less), in stock = Facebook in stock
  3. OpenCart quantity of (0 or less), out of stock = Facebook out of stock
  4. OpenCart quantity of (0 or less), pre order = Facebook pre order
  5. OpenCart quantity of (0 or less), 2-3 days = Facebook in stock
* Improved the pixel firing for Opencart v3.x with Journal theme
* Improved the function Resync products to use feed approach instead of API. This helps to reduce the webserver load, especially if there are many products.
* Added mechanism to add version number to Javascript files as suffix. This will bust the client browser cache, reduce the need to Clear browser cache and force reload and avoid bugs on client browser side because they are using older version of the Javascript files.

* Fixed a bug with sales end period to exclude out the sales end date on Facebook, eg if the sales end date is set as on 30 May 2019, the final end date of the sales will be 29 May 2019 23:59
* Added mapping for predefined OpenCart product status into Facebook catalog availability. Note that Facebook Page Shop only shows "Not available" for out of stock and Checkout to website" for all other status. The logic is as follow:
  OpenCart Preorder = Facebook Preorder
  OpenCart 2-3 days = Facebook In stock
  OpenCart Out of stock = Facebook Out of stock
  OpenCart In stock, subtract Yes, Zero quantity = Facebook Out of stock
  OpenCart In stock, subtract Yes, 1 or more quantity = Facebook In stock
  OpenCart In stock, subtract No (regardless of quantity) = Facebook In stock
